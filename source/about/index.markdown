Namaskara, 

I

* am CS guy and the “Hello world” phrase is the first thing that comes to my mind whenever I'm starting anything new.
* find TED videos very interesting and inspiring.
* Love travelling. Especially long drives. 
* am interested in photography. But not too much concerned about technicalities. 
* Occasionally click photos from handheld devices to compile memories.
* believe "Quora is curiosity, never satisfied!". Yes, I am a huge fan of Quora !
* have lived in Coorg, Mysore or Bangalore at some point or the other.
